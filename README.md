## How It Works

### Quest Detection
The plugin monitors your enrolled quests and identifies those that:
- Are actively enrolled (`enrolledAt` is set)
- Are not yet completed (`completedAt` is null)
- Have not expired

### Farming Process
Once a quest is detected, the plugin:
1. Identifies the quest type (WATCH_VIDEO, PLAY_ON_DESKTOP, etc.)
2. Determines required farming duration
3. Spools a fake game/stream/activity to Discord
4. Tracks progress via heartbeat events
5. Attempts multiple completion methods if progress stalls
6. Automatically marks the quest as complete

### Fallback Mechanism
If standard completion fails:
- Retries progress submission up to `maxFallbackAttempts` times
- Attempts direct API calls to complete quests
- Forces completion when 90% progress is reached or retries are exhausted

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin doesn't detect quests
- Ensure you have **enrolled** in at least one quest manually
- Check the console (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) for error messages with the `[FarmQuests]` prefix
- Enable **Verbose logging** to see detailed debug output
- Plugin initializes all settings on first load – check `FarmQuests.config.json` was created

### Quests not completing
- Check if Discord is in focus (some operations require focus)
- For `PLAY_ON_DESKTOP` quests, ensure you're using the desktop app
- For `STREAM_ON_DESKTOP` quests, you need at least 1 other person in the VC
- Verify the quest hasn't expired
- Check **Max fallback attempts** setting – increase if quests are timing out (default: 30)

### Settings not saving
- Verify `FarmQuests.config.json` exists in the plugins folder
- Check that settings are valid (e.g., numbers >= 1)
- The plugin has automatic setting initialization that runs on startup
- Try toggling a setting – if it updates `config.json`, the plugin is working
- Clear your browser cache and reload Discord (`Ctrl+R`)

### Console errors
- Look for messages starting with `[FarmQuests]` (new unified logging)
- Enable **Verbose logging** to see detailed operation traces
- For missing stores, run this in DevTools:
```javascript
Webpack.getModule(m=>Object.keys(m||{}).slice(0,10)).slice(0,20)
```
- If API module is missing, basic quest completion should still work via store methods

## API Support

The plugin attempts to use Discord's internal API via multiple pathways:
- Store-based completion methods
- Direct heartbeat endpoints
- Fallback mutation strategies

If one method fails, the plugin will automatically try alternatives.

## Performance Tips

- **Reduce check interval** – Lower the "Interval to check for new quests" for faster detection (uses more resources)
- **Adjust concurrent farms** – Set to 1-2 if experiencing lag; increase for faster farming
- **Disable verbose logging** – Turn off debug logs when not troubleshooting to reduce CPU usage

## Known Limitations

- ❌ Cannot click "Accept Quest" button (must enroll manually)
- ⚠️ PLAY_ACTIVITY quests require an active voice channel with at least 1 other member
- ⚠️ Some quest types may fail if Discord internals change
- ⚠️ The fake game/stream spoof may not work if Discord's anti-cheat detection evolves

## FAQ

**Q: Is this against Discord's ToS?**  
A: This plugin mimics legitimate user behavior but may violate Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

**Q: Why do I need to accept quests manually?**  
A: The plugin currently doesn't have UI automation for the quest acceptance modal. This is a limitation of BetterDiscord's capabilities.

**Q: What if a quest fails to complete?**  
A: The plugin logs errors to the console. Enable **Verbose logging** and check for specific error messages. If issues persist, the quest config may have changed.

**Q: Can I farm multiple quest types at once?**  
A: Yes! Adjust the **Concurrent farms** setting. Default is 3, meaning up to 3 quests can farm simultaneously.
